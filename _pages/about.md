## Biography

I received my degree in Electronics & Computer Science highest honours from [Ecole Nationale Superieure de l'Electronique et de ses Applications](https://www.ensea.fr/en/) in 2025. In 2024, I was a exchange student in AI & Robotics at [Sapienza University of Rome](https://www.uniroma1.it/en/pagina-strutturale/home), Italy. During my master's internship, I worked on robotics optimization at Pollen Robotics x Hugging Face under the supervision of [RÃ©mi Fabre](https://fr.linkedin.com/in/remifabre) and [Vincent Padois.](https://people.bordeaux.inria.fr/vincent.padois/index.html)

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
